# Worker Agent Documentation

- Update `apps/worker/AGENTS.md` whenever job orchestration, executor lifecycles, or Redis handling changes.
- Use this directory to log container orchestration quirks, queue tuning, and operational runbooks.
- Record bridges or contracts with Convex/web so downstream agents know how to consume worker updates.
