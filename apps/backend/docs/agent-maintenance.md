# Backend Agent Documentation

- Update `apps/backend/AGENTS.md` whenever Convex schema, mutations, or deployment processes evolve.
- Record complex backend workflows here so worker and web agents understand how to integrate with new APIs.
- Note any required follow-up actions (codegen, migrations) after backend changes.
