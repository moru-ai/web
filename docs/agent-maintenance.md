# Agent Maintenance Checklist

- After any code change, review the relevant `AGENTS.md` and update the guidance if the workflows or expectations change.
- Capture deeper architectural or process updates in this `docs/` directory so every app and package stays aligned.
- When adding new surfaces (apps, packages, services), create an `AGENTS.md` at that root and seed it with context for future agents.
